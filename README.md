   title: Big Data Analytics in Cyber Security and Threat Research
   abstract: >
       The introduction of big data poses new security threats for the
       organizations and the consequences can cause catastrophic damages
       for organizations. Newer threats are sophisticated enough that the
       existing security mechanisms might be ineffective to thwart the
       attacks. However, big data analytics and tools can help the
       organizations to detect the threats and take protective
       measures. Moreover, big data analytics and machine learning
       together can detect newer threats which was not possible before. In
       this paper, we discuss some new cybersecurity threats and
       challenges that has been bolstered by big data and then we discuss
       some new big data related security mechanisms which can help the
       organizations to protect their resources.
