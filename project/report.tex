\appendix

%We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the proceedings script we have does not allow this.

W%hen you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
%issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
%only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
%cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
%we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
%point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
%just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
%submission than doing the check in haste.
