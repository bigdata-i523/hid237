        The introduction of big data poses new security threats for the
        organizations and the consequences can cause catastrophic damages
        for organizations. Newer threats are sophisticated
        enough that the existing security mechanisms might be ineffective
        to thwart the attacks. However, big data analytics and tools can help
        the organizations to detect the threats and take protective measures.
        Moreover, big data analytics and machine learning together can detect
        newer threats which was not possible before. In this paper, we discuss
        some new cybersecurity threats and challenges that has been bolstered
        by big data and then we discuss some new big data related security
        mechanisms which can help the organizations to protect their resources.

     Social media has become a virtual society for everyone where billions of
     people are  interacting everyday. With the    humonguous number of users,
     it has become extremely difficult manage and track the users behavior in
     social media.  Malicious actors leverage this weakness of social media
     platforms and target regular users with threats that includes
     cyberbullying, malware distribution, spam distribution, fake news,
     and propaganda.The consequence of such threats can  affect large number
     of people,and can result in catastrophic damage. However, identifying
     the malicious users from the huge number of regular users remain the
     most challenging problem for the social media platforms.Big data analytics
     can be one of the most powerful tool  for the social media platforms
     to prevent such attacks on social media platforms.
     This paper discusses the threats of social medias and
     the ways to use big data analytics to prevent such
     attacks on social media platforms.

    abstract: >
       People with visual impairments can live their lives more independent
       with the help of various camera-assisted technologies. They capture
       photos and asks their question on camera based applications.
       The services automaticallyanalyzes their questions and photos
       to help them various challenges in their daily lives.
       This report analyzes their questions and taken photos
       to understand their everyday challenges.
