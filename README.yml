        The introduction of big data poses new security threats for the organizations
        and the consequences can cause catastrophic damages for organizations. Newer
        threats are sophisticated enough that the existing security mechanisms might
        be ineffective to thwart the attacks. However, big data analytics and tools
        can help the organizations to detect the threats and take protective measures.
        Moreover, big data analytics and machine learning together can detect newer
        threats which was not possible before. In this paper, we discuss some new
        cybersecurity threats and challenges that has been bolstered by big data and
        then we discuss some new big data related security mechanisms which can help
        the organizations to protect their resources.

      Social media has become a virtual society for everyone where bil-lions of people are interacting everyday. With the humongous num-ber of users, it has become extremely dicult to manage and trackthe users behavior in social media. Malicious actors leverage thisweakness of social media platforms and target regular users withthreats that includes cyberbullying, malware distribution, spamdistribution, fake news, and propaganda. e consequence of suchthreats can aect large number of people, and can result in cata-strophic damage. However, identifying the malicious users from thehuge number of regular users remain the most challenging problemfor the social media platforms. Big data analytics can be one of themost powerful tool for the social media platforms to prevent thesuch aacks on social media platforms. is paper discusses thethreats of social medias and the ways to use big data analytics toprevent such aacks on social media platforms
