        The introduction of big data poses new security threats for the organizations
        and the consequences can cause catastrophic damages for organizations. Newer
        threats are sophisticated enough that the existing security mechanisms might
        be ineffective to thwart the attacks. However, big data analytics and tools
        can help the organizations to detect the threats and take protective measures.
        Moreover, big data analytics and machine learning together can detect newer
        threats which was not possible before. In this paper, we discuss some new
        cybersecurity threats and challenges that has been bolstered by big data and
        then we discuss some new big data related security mechanisms which can help
        the organizations to protect their resources.

   abstract: >
       People with visual impairments can live their lives more independent with the help of various camera-assisted 
       technologies. They capture photos and asks their question on camera based applications. The services automatically
       analyzes their questions and photos to help them various challenges in their daily lives. This report analyzes their
